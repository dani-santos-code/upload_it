## Image Uploader Client Code

This is the FE implementation of `UploadIt`, a webapp that allows users to upload pictures. They can upload images of up to 100kbs. The images are set to be private by default, but users can make them public if they want their images to be added to Public Image gallery.

In the project directory `client`, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
